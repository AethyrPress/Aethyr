# My Super Game

## Description

Here goes a quick description of your game. Be concise and explain in very few words the gameplay and why it's really cool and why everyone should play it.

## History

Add some storytelling here. Not the scenario of your game but rather some background of the creation process: why are you making this game? Most projects starts with a cool story.

## Features

- List some "Key Sellings Points" to grab player's attention.
- Don't be too generic ("pixel art graphics!"), don't be too pretentious ("most incredible game experience!").
- Also, people like numbers, so you can add some (450 weapons, hundreds of levels, dozens of hours of playtime!)
- Need ideas? Maybe explain some game modes?
- It would be a nice place to say something about multiplayer, if you have some.
- Have you translated your game? (You probably should btw.)
